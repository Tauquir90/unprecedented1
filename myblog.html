	I have decided from today onwards i will 
not use <u style = "color:blue;">social media</u> anymore beacause of various resons.First reason is
that it is hampering my career very badly. Secondly it is affecting mine mental
stability...So i have decided to remain alone for the prolonged period of time 
until or unless i matches my real soul mate...So now i am the source of my <b style = "color:black;font-size:162%;" >inspiration</b>
to overcome,accomplish and norture myself in a positive direction that will be fill of
active energy that that will be omnidirectional...In the last 2 years i have not done anything
great because i have been stucked by the circumstances..Now its the right time to knock myself for me 
so that i can establish myself on my feet
and from there i can launch myself...Days are gone when i was treated like a fragile creature....Now its
my duty and its a big challenge to establish myself...So from today onwards i don't wanna waste even a single nanoseconds.
I do not have much time...Its like do or situation for me..Its like now or never situation for me...so i am backing
myself because i know that there is only one person who can work wonders for me..that person is myself...
To be honest i am having some of the negative approaches like laziness,over reacting,short tamper...I will sort it out as soon 
as possible because these are stumbling block in the way of my success..I need to redefine the word attitude,ego and self respect...
These are just the vacant container i will fill them with a lot of caution because these container play a vital role in the race
of life....Now the number 1 Attitude.it  means how i will behave smartly in a specified situation ...situation can vary but
my smart behaviour should not be affected because its my intrinsic property that should remain preserved...
Now second one Ego ....it means as per me i should not allow any one to access me because only i only hold the key to control
and access myself.....Now the number 3 is Self respect ...its really very important because as per me it is the ornament that i always 
keep wearing whatever be the situation....I would like to interpolate it beyond further...If i am having this..if i am above 20 years 
i should start earning so that i can become financially independent...This is the biggest level of self respect can person can have
for them......I have reduced weight upto some extent..I would like to creep that weight so that personality may groom even more...
I have to take proper sleep of 8 hrs during night time so that i can relax enough and can work efficiently during day time...Now i need to
ponder deep before taking any action because now i do not afford to mistakes.....SO in a nutshell i wanna say that i need to perfectly perfet and
precise while during any activity beacuse performing any mistake can cause to work from the previous destination....so stay always 
focussed and activated.....One thing more when u do commitment to u ..u need to commit one thing more that u will commiy that commitment efficiently 
..............................These some of the precious things that was inside me that i unleashed on my notepad....
</p><p><b style = "color:blue; font-size:150%;" > Now I would like to add some more my experience..Take one thing at a time with the immense level of commitment and 
 passion..There are some of the creatures in this world that gives me the motivation..In that list no 1 is Lion...King of the animal
kingdom..hold the fearless attitude like a Lion..Despite of not being the largest animal Lion is king that is because of attitude..
Now here comes the Eagle ..King of the birds Kingdom...when all the birds search for the shelter in adverse situation Eagle fly higher and higher..
Here comes the Shark.....Shark always swims in the forward direction irrespective of the stream.....These are the three creatures 
that gives a great lesson.......
